# Christmas Tree Ornament 2023
This project is the start of hopefully a yearly tradition in creating an electronics project for the Christmas holidays.  
The pcb resembles a Christmas tree with silkscreen ornaments and LEDs for effect.

There are two modes in the way the PCB can be used;

1. Mode (1) is a setup with two sets of red LEDs that flashes in a shifting pattern controlled by a 555-timer circuit.
2. Mode (2) is a simple power-configuration for slow-flashing RGB LEDs.

Please see schematics documentation for guidance in choosing which mode to solder and create.
